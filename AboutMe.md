I always feel awkward when I am tasked to provide interesting facts about myself (one of my facts). I am tall but bad at basketball. I have a sizable coin collection. I am doing this assignment the morning that it's due. I enjoy looking at maps. I figure that six sentences qualifies as a pargagraph.
